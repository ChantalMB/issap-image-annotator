**NOTE:** On first install enter `npm install` after navigating to the app folder

- To start the app: `npm run dev`
- To start the server (only necessary for saving project-- currently runs like a microservice until I figure out how to correctly integrate this...): 
    - In new CLI window navigate to the `server` folder
    - Enter `node server.js`
