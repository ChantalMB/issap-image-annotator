## TO DO:
- [ ] Make icons use regular form of importing
- [ ] Scale image to reasonable size when loaded in (currently canvas just scaled to image dimensions)
- [ ] Add zoom in/zoom out for canvas —> ANNOTATIONS MUST SCALE TOO
- [ ] Make app dark mode
- [ ] Auto-save by writing to json
- [ ] Disable toolbar if not on canvas
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Current date does not successfully update when called in artifact annotations
- [ ] Radio button selection issue in columns
- [ ] Autoscroll to newly added row in annotation editor
- [ ] Make annotation editor tabs + zoom buttons sticky
- [ ] Must be able to delete shapes + associated row —> add a “-” beside each row and this will trigger deletion of row + shape on canvas
- Use store variable to control this, if you can figure out how to remove the row then I can figure out the shape canvas
- [ ] Show all images as grid when waffle-like icon is selected
    - [ ] Building off this —> filter images by criteria

`npm run dev` to start
